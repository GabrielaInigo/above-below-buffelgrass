# Above and belowground effects of buffelgrass invasion in the Sonoran Desert

This repository contains the analysis scripts and data for the research project "Above and belowground effects of buffelgrass invasion in the Sonoran Desert" developed for the master's thesis of Gabriela Inigo at the University of Arizona.

## Project Overview

This research investigates the ecological impacts of buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) in the Sonoran Desert, examining both aboveground vegetation dynamics and belowground soil properties and microbial communities. The project includes analyses of:
- Vegetation composition and abundance
- Soil physical and chemical properties
- Soil microbial community characteristics

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

1. `buffelgrass_vegetation/`
    - Contains vegetation data and analysis scripts

2. `buffelgrass_soilphyschem/`
   - Contains soil physical and chemical data and analysis scripts

3. `buffelgrass_soilmicrobiome/`
   - Contains soil microbial community data and analysis scripts
